Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the **University of California, Berkeley** in [Jill Banfield's lab](https://www.banfieldlab.com/) at the [Innovative Genomics Institute](https://innovativegenomics.org/) and the Earth & Planetary Sciences Department. 🧬 My research focuses on the microbial “who & what” using big genomic data to understand dynamic ecosystems. 🌎
* **Current Focus:** Soil microbial ecology and carbon sequestration using genome-resolved metagenomics.

---

Previously, I completed my Ph.D. at the **Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego** in Paul Jensen's laboratory. My doctoral research focused on: 🧫 Discovering novel compounds in ocean sediment bacteria (signaling molecules and antibiotics). 🌊 Developing bioinformatic tools to study the evolution of microbial biosynthetic machinery. 

## Research Interests
* **Environmental Genomics:** Genome-resolved metagenomics & big data pipelines with a microbial ecology lens.
* **Microbial Ecology:** Understanding community assembly and evolution in soil & marine ecosystems. 
* **Biotechnology:** Translating microbial discoveries into tangible solutions, like the discovery of novel microbial compounds and biosynthetic pathways.
