Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at **University of California, Berkeley** in [Jill Banfield's lab](https://www.banfieldlab.com/) at the [Innovative Genomics Institute](https://innovativegenomics.org/) and the Earth & Planetary Sciences Department. 

* 🧬 My research focuses on the microbial “who & what” using big genomic data to understand dynamic ecosystems. 🌎
* **Current Focus:** Soil microbial ecology and carbon sequestration using genome-resolved metagenomics.

Previously, I completed my Ph.D. at the **Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego** in Paul Jensen's laboratory where I was a marine microbe explorer. My doctoral research focused on: 
* Discovering novel compounds in ocean sediment bacteria (signaling molecules and antibiotics).
* Developing bioinformatic tools to study the evolution of microbial biosynthetic machinery.
